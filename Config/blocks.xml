<!-- 
  The main thing here is to see if I can make it so you can pick up doors, especially
  locked ones...  To do that I need to add a 'CanPickup' property with value 'true'

    <property name="CanPickup" value="true"/>

  Maybe blocks like this:

    <block name="houseFrontDoor1_v1">
      <property name="Place" value="Door"/>  // build restriction
      <property name="Tags" value="door"/>
      <property name="BlockTag" value="Door"/>

  Other tags:

    <block name="commercialDoor2_v1">
    <block name="vaultDoor01">
    <block name="vaultDoor03_Powered">
    <block name="ironDoor1_v1">
    <block name="metalReinforcedDoorWooden">
    <block name="secureReinforcedDoorWooden">
    <block name="secureDoorWooden">

-->

<configs>
  <!-- ATTEMPT: find blocks/block that have a property with name 'BlockTag' and value 'Door' 
        and let player pick them up...
  -->
  <!-- DANG, this doesn't seem to work, but at least it gives no errors... -->
  <append xpath="/blocks/block/property[@name='BlockTag' and @value='Door']/..">
    <property name="CanPickup" value="true"/>
  </append>


  <!-- ATTEMPT: make 'frame shapes' (ones player can pickup) have a material with a
    lot of HP, here we change to steel...

    from blocks.xml steel shapes:
    	<property name="Material" value="Msteel_shapes"/>

    Also I'm removing the property Tags=wood because that seems to cause my shotgun
    to annihilate the blocks :).  
  -->
  <set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='frameShapes']/property[@name='Material']/@value">Msteel_shapes</set>
  <remove xpath="/blocks/block[@name='frameShapes']/property[@name='Tags']" />
